  					Pre-submit tracking is an advanced feature of Rejoiner that identifies a customer as soon as they enter their email into a form field - even if they haven’t clicked [submit] - allowing you to follow up with more people who abandon your sign up form and drive more subscriptions.

          “Every sign up that Rejoiner helps us recover increases the long-term value of our company. It's not just a one-time purchase; it's a subscription customer who is going to be with us for many months/years to come. My favorite thing about working with them is that they are always available to assist with anything we need, even with our crazy time difference.”
