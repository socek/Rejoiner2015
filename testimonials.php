                <p>Rejoiner's abandoned cart retargeting platform was a critical part of our email strategy during the holiday season. Implementation was fast and we started seeing results immediately. Even better, the ROI was clear and tangible. Rejoiner's platform was easy to work with and flexible enough to meet our unique retargeting requirements.</p>

                <h6>Director of Marketing and Ecommerce at Rishi Tea</h6>
                <p>Initially, our ecommerce team wasn't sure whether or not Rejoiner's services would move the needle on our abandoned carts, however I was utterly mistaken. The Rejoiner team helped us to craft a series of appropriate responses to those potential customers, and our site has not only benefited from recovering those customers but also by learning a thing or two about some weak points in our our service that we've addressed to great success. Sales are up and customers are happy.</p>

                <p>Rejoiner offers a very easy install, excellent support to merchants, and transparent reporting on re-captured customers. The cost is very affordable, as it's only a tiny fraction compared to total monthly revenues we're able to recover. Simple yet effective.</p>
