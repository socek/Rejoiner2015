        <h1>Here’s How eCommerce Company, Peak Design, Uses Rejoiner To Reduce Their Cart Abandonment Rate and Drive More Revenue</h1>
        <span>
          <b>Peak design found out that their average recovery rate was 16%</b> and that number has stayed the same over the life of their email remarketing campaigns. The average recovery value is roughly the same as their average cart value, which means customers usually purchase the entire abandoned cart whenever they come back to purchase an abandoned cart.
